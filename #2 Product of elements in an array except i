Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6]

#Here is the code:- 
#Python 3.0

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
product = 1

for i in range(0, len(arr)):
  product = product * arr[i]

for i in range(0, len(arr)):
  arr[i] = product//arr[i]

print(arr)
