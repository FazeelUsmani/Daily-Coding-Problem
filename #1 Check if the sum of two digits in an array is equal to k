Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was recently asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

def sum(a, k):

  for i in range(0, len(a)):
    num = a[i]
    for j in range(i+1, len(a)):
      if num + a[j] == k:
        return True
  
  else:
    return False 
  
  
a = [10, 15, 3, 7]
k = 11
print(sum(a,k))
